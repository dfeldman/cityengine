/**
 * Experiment 1 of MODELING_IMPROVEMENT_1.md — builders written by one experimental run.
 *
 * Each experiment owns exactly ONE of these files so that several can run at once without touching the
 * same lines. The record is already imported and spread into SF_BUILDERS by sf/index.ts, so filling this in
 * is the only edit a run needs to make. Builders here are named `e1_<something>` to keep the flat
 * PROCEDURAL keyspace collision-free (BUGS.md #92).
